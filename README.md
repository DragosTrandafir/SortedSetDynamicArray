# SortedSet
C++ representation of Sorted Set as an abstract data type - using DYNAMIC ARRAY 
This repository offers a representation of a sorted set, as a data structure, having implemented multiple header and cpp files, together with some tests.

The SortedSetIterator.h and its cpp offer the header and the representation of an iterator which let us run through the set and perform multiple operations.
The SortedSet.h and its cpp offer the header and the representation of the set itself, with all the private arguments and operation functions.

TO RUN THE PROJECT, create a project in a C++ IDE, I recommend Visual Studio Community or C Lion. Copy all the headers (.h) and cpp (.cpp) files and run the App.cpp. All the test should run correctly.
You can also see the complexities in the implementation of the functions and some explanations regarding the implementation.
